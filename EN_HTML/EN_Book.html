        I read recently that the treatment of depression colitis annually
        nearly forty-three billion dollars in the United States in losses of
        production and absenteeism. In other words, depression is a huge
        waste of time and money. It's such a haemorrhage of resources:
        even something supposed to be enjoyable, like time spent in London,
        turn into a disaster. On its own, the feeling of guilt that I
        constantly felt, not just because of all the waste I wasted
        in London, but of what I was missing in every part of my life-the
        my time at Harvard was primarily spent supporting my health
        complete mental depression. - would have been enough on its own to cause a Un
        evening, while I was there, I met Rhoda Koenig, so
        book reviewer at New York magazine, which had set up shop on the edge of
        the Thames because she loved the place much more than New York. Rhodes
        and I had been more or less friends since high school, when I had
        did an internship at the revue, but when we had dinner in London, she
        annoyed: "I can't bear to hear you," she repeated. When I had
        your age, I was saving money, I was the waitress pendant
        months to be able to go to Europe. I didn't have a lot of money,
        so I was staying in youth hostels, which were very
        uncomfortable, but I was so excited to be there, I was going to
        museums, galleries, I saw plays, it was
        wonderful. But all you seem able to do is
        complaining that you miss your ex-boyfriend, and that you can't hook up!
        It's ridiculous ! »
